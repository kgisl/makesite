<p>1 Gain exposure to as many technologies as you can, as early as possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Top priority: School students are now encouraged to either use, consume, modify, create AI technologies before their graduation from 12th</li>
</ul>
<p>2 The more you get out of your comfort zone, the more you create meaningful learnings for life</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you graduate from college, emerge with the battle scars of being a brave, learned skillful entrepreneur (failure is very likely and that is perfectly okay)</li>
</ul>
<p>3 Very few of the student population are fortunate enough to receive advice like the above.
Among those who get to hear the advice, only a few are alert and aware of what is <em>really</em> being told.
And among those few, only a few are fortunate enough to do something about it and benefit from it.</p>
<p><code>EDU</code> is about</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to as many things as possible, and hopefully one such exposure triggers genuine curiosity in the learner for certain things</li>
<li>Discipline and rigour to develop that curiosity to the next level, including pursue higher learning. Learn concepts and skills relevant to a particular domain, and remember, that piece of paper (degree) is useful to signal others that you are worthy of being invested upon</li>
<li>U is all about You. Learning about yourself, managing yourself (energy, time, attitude, emotions, spiritual) and creating the networks and being part of communities which encourage you to the next level; reaching out to people who are part of your support structure, people who love you, and help you stay resilient to stay the course</li>
</ul>
