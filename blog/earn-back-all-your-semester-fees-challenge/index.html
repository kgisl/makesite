<h2>Notes for Admin</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>An <code>#EarnBackChallenge</code> for 1st year students belonging to the CSE and IT departments of KITE has been defined as follows:
- Complete a 1000-line Text Editor program to be written entirely in C language
- This is aligned to the syllabus of the 8251 course on &quot;C Programming&quot; which is part of academic workload for the 2nd semester
-  Watch the link <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/earnBack">https://bit.ly/earnBack</a></strong> for announcements of other challenges along similar lines as and when they are accepted by the Principals of the respective colleges
- The challenge in itself is real-world project and should provide for outstanding coding skills. More importantly, it will  boost self-confidence and generate genuine commitment to further pursue other technical skills</p>
<h3>Registration Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students may nominate themselves to participate in the challenge with their respective course faculty</li>
<li>Once their application has been vetted by the course faculty, they will have to start working on the challenge on a regular basis. This will be in addition to whatever existing semester academic workload they might have.</li>
<li>Weekly review of the student's progress towards completing the challenge will be done by the faculty along with professional mentors from KGiSL</li>
<li>On successful completion of the project before the deadline will entitle students to earn back the 2nd semester fee that has already been paid by them</li>
</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li>While it is primarily open to all students in both the CSE and IT department, other students (from other colleges) are also welcome to take up the challenge. By default, they will not have the opportunity to earn back their semester fees, unless it has been pre-approved by the management.</li>
<li>Encourage only students who are truly motivated to sign up for the challenge. If they should resort to plagirism or any other dishonest methods, they will be blacklisted from future challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proposals from other Departments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Similar Challenge proposals are encouraged from all departments of KGCAS and KITE. Proposals are encouraged from non-computer science stream departments as well. They don't necessarily have to be for the 1st year students. They can be designed to be relevant to other year students as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge proposal can be discussed orally and submitted in writing to the Principal and the Expert Panel comprising Principal, Vice Principal and Deans who will vett the proposal, set the deadline and eventually decide on the award of the EarnBack of the semester fees by the participaing students.</li>
<li>For further queries, please contact the above-mentioned panel, thank you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are approximately 15 departments between KITE, CAS and IIM. The goal is to have a minimum of 15 EarnBack challenges that are engaging a group of students simultaneously</p>
</li>
</ul>
