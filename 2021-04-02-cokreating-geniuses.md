## co-Kreating Geniuses

CoKreating Geniuses is the motto that captures the Reason for Being (the raison detre if you will) of KGISL Education and it is a quick way to remind us of the work that goes on at KG College of Arts and Science (KGCAS), at our engineering college KGISL Institute of Technology (KITE) and MCA-college KGISL Institute of information Management (IIM).

Genius - is the word that reminds us of potential that is inherently present in every student who is pursuing their higher studies at KGCAS, KITE or KGISL-IIM. 

Co-Kreation - we purposely spell it with a 'K' to remind both faculty and student of 
   - the K in knowledge economy that we are all increasingly become a part of 
   - the K in the knowledge that needs to literally co-created inside the brain of the student, by not the age-old methods of "chalk and talk" or by the faculty assuming the "sage on the stage" attitude, and instead, be the "guide by the side" which is the most effective method given the Internet era and resources that are widely available 
   - and last but not the least, remind us of "K" in the word Hackathon, which is the new Education model of providing an immersive experience to increase the engagement of the student to create intrinsic interest in developing the skills in the domain of her interest 

So, whether you the dedicated faculty member, or the most motivated student, please come join us at KG - K for coKreation, and G for Geniuses - please join us - we are having serious fun, I repeat SERIOUS FUN in co-Kreating Geniuses at the 45-acre KGISL campus that has been designed as the intersection of work, learning and technology, so you may experience a truly differntiated  learning experience that stays with you longer after you have graduated, which in turn will be the foundation for an exciting future!

Remember, you are genius and the world needs your contribution!
