## co-Kreating Geniuses

Let me ask you this question (I want you to seriously give it a thought before you answer it, alright?): Do you think you are a genius? Regardless of what your response might have been, the ONLY answer to that question is: OF COURSE, YES - You are a GENIUS and you might actually not believe it! 

Not only do I sincerely believe that you are a GENIUS, but I will go one step further: I believe you are a GENIUS and the world needs your UNIQUE contribution. And it is about time you start believe that as well! 

The 10 second `tl;dl`: KGISL Edu is all about transforming students into geniuses (in other words, talent that is desired by world class companies) by providing them with a truly exemplary and exceptional learning experience. 

The motto **CoKreating Geniuses** perfectly captures the Reason for Being (*raison d ^etre*, if you will) of KGISL Education and the phrase, containing both K and G,  is effective in reminding us of the work that goes on at KG College of Arts and Science (KGCAS), at our engineering college KGISL Institute of Technology (KITE) and our 2 decade old MCA-college KGISL Institute of information Management (IIM).

Genius - is the word that reminds us of potential that is inherently present in every student who is pursuing their higher studies at KGCAS, KITE or KGISL-IIM. 

Co-Kreation - we purposely spell it with a 'K' to remind both faculty and student of 
   - the K in knowledge economy that we are all increasingly become a part of 
   - the K in the knowledge that needs to literally co-created inside the brain of the student, by not the age-old methods of "chalk and talk" or by the faculty assuming the "sage on the stage" attitude, and instead, be the "guide by the side" which is the most effective method given the Internet era and resources that are widely available 
   - and last but not the least, remind us of "K" in the word Hackathon, which is the new Education model of providing an immersive experience to increase the engagement of the student to create intrinsic interest in developing the skills in the domain of her interest 

So, whether you the dedicated faculty member, or the most motivated student, please come join us at KG - K for coKreation, and G for Geniuses - please join us - we are having serious fun, I repeat SERIOUS FUN in co-Kreating Geniuses at the 45-acre KGISL campus that has been designed as the intersection of work, learning and technology, so you may experience a truly differntiated  learning experience that stays with you longer after you have graduated, which in turn will be the foundation for an exciting future!

And let me remind you again: You are genius and the world needs your contribution!
