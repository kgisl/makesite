<!-- title: EDU stands for -->

1 Gain exposure to as many technologies as you can, as early as possible 
  - Top priority: School students are now encouraged to either use, consume, modify, create AI technologies before their graduation from 12th 

2 The more you get out of your comfort zone, the more you create meaningful learning for life
  - Before you graduate from college, emerge with the battle scars of being a brave, learned skillful entrepreneur (failure is very likely and that is perfectly okay) - ```KG Blazer ```

3 Very few of the student population are fortunate enough to receive advice like the above. 
Among those who get to hear the advice, only a few are alert and aware of what is _really_ being told.
And among those few, only a few are fortunate enough to do something about it and benefit from it. 

```EDU``` is about 
  - Exposure to as many things as possible, and hopefully one such exposure triggers genuine curiosity in the learner for certain things
  - Discipline and rigour to develop that curiosity to the next level, including pursue higher learning. Learn concepts and skills relevant to a particular domain, and remember, that piece of paper (degree) is useful to signal others that you are worthy of being invested upon 
  - U is all about You. Learning about yourself, managing yourself (energy, time, attitude, emotions, spiritual) and creating the networks and being part of communities which encourage you to the next level; reaching out to people who are part of your support structure, people who love you, and help you stay resilient to stay the course
