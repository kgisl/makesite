**Help Launch the Ten Day Daily (TDD) Steam  Campaign**

The Reduction of the viral shedding using steam inhalations has been proven scientifically.  **Steam inhalation for at least 20 min (4 cycles of 5 min) daily, for 10 days** can halt the corona virus spread in our entire nation. Please see the full study published by Meyer Children's Hospital, Florence, Italy at  [http://j.mp/tddSteam](http://j.mp/tddSteam). 

COVID-19 can be killed by inhaling steam from the nose or mouth, eliminating the coronavirus. If the entire population of our country was mobilized to do a steam drive campaign for only 10 days, the pandemic will soon end. The steam drive can be done by all the citizens in their respective homes or at government designated public spots with adequate social distancing. 

As a role model for the entire nation, **I invite each and everyone of you to launch the `"Ten Day Daily (TDD) Steam Campaign"` at Coimbatore city** and bring awareness to it throughout Tamil Nadu and the rest of the country. 

Yours truly,

### Brief Summary of the Study
*https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04743349*

  - The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is an RNA virus    coated with a capsid and a peri-capsid crossed by glycoprotein    structures. The external proteic structure, which attacks human    cells, is a potential target to therapeutic interventions against    virus replication in airways.

  - Since high temperature can cause irreversible denaturation of proteins and loss of SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 infectivity was obtained after heating at 56 â—¦C for 15 and 30 min in liquid environments respectively, we designed a protocol aimed at damaging SARS-CoV-2 capsid through steam inhalation cycles. Although the ominous consequences of COVID 19 infections has directed medical attention toward solidly established medical approaches, the European Pharmacopoeia VI edition also quotes steam inhalations as a procedure to treat of respiratory diseases.
- Based on these suggestions we established a quasi-randomized clinical trial enrolling 200 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients in whom rhino-pharyngeal-swab revealed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study protocol consisted of exposure of airway mucosae to humidified steam (pH 8 per NaHCO3 and hypertonic 15 g/L NaCl) through steam inhalation for at least 20 min (4 cycles of 5 min) daily, for 10 days.
- The objective of the study is to reduce the viral shedding using steam inhalations.
