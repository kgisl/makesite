<!-- title: ChangeMaster Challenge  -->

## Can you give Change?

The new "Master" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single `100`, `50` or `25` rupee note. A "Master" ticket costs `25 rupees`.

The clerk at the box office is Ramesh. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line. 

Can Ramesh sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return `1`, if Ramesh can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return `0`.

**NOTE**: As part of settling the change, Ramesh gives away 50 rupee notes first, if there should be any. 

### Examples:

```python
tickets([25, 25, 50]) # => YES 
tickets([25, 100]) # => NO
# Ramesh will not have enough money to  
# give change to 100 rupees
tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) # => NO
# Ramesh will not have the right bills to
# give 75 rupees of change (you can't make 
# two bills of 25 from one of 50)
```

## Variation 2 

Assume people in line have 10 rupee notes (for e.g. 30 is 3 times 10). To start with, assume Ramesh carries with him 5 rupee bills (9 in number). Modify the logic to accommodate this situation. 

### Use as deemed fit  
```python
import copy
 
def make_change(options, cashbox): 
    
    for combo in options:
        for denom in combo: 
            if denom not in cashbox or \
                combo[denom] > cashbox[denom]:
                    break
        else:
            return combo
        
    return None
